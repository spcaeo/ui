/**
 * The grid query: what the user is asking for, independent of any framework,

 *
 * Zero dependencies and no build step — this file runs as-is in a browser, in
 * Node, and on a server. That matters because the SAME parsing and validation
 * has to happen in both places: the client reads the URL to render, the server
 * reads it to build a database query, and if those two disagree about what
 * `page=0` or an unknown sort field means, you get bugs that only appear on a
 * shared link.
